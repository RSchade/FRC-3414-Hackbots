To-do notes:

1. Restructure Autonomous (wheel control PID)
2. Fix AutoShooter so it doesn't extend BaseRobot


We want the following values:

Screw Sensor Low: False when safe, true when screw is at low value
Screw Sensor High: False when safe, true when screw is at high value
Shooter Piston: True when extended, False when retracted
Loader Sensor: True when encountering a frisbee, False when clear
