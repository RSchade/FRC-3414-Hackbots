To-do notes:


We want the following values:

Screw Sensor Low: False when safe, true when screw is at low value
Screw Sensor High: False when safe, true when screw is at high value
Shooter Piston: True when extended, False when retracted
Loader Sensor: True when encountering a frisbee, False when clear


Classes to fix:

AutoShooter - Make it auto shoot (whole thing is broken)
DistanceFinder - Find the scaling constant
DriveTrain - Adjust scaling factor for comfortability
PID - possibly change to a counter instead of encoder
ShooterLoader - Make it auto update
ShooterScrew - Make it return the correct values for encoder stuff

Put the camera image on the smart dashboard instead of random other dashboard.
Should the lifter start up or down?
