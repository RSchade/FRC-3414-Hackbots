world_old is the one we have been playing on
ftb_world_new is the newly generated world with ores but no buildings

The NPC village is changed because of the modpack, so you may have to copy and paste Matt's house in the village somewhere else. See if you can get the farm plots in the village as well. Other buildings I know of:

- My shack (with chests below)
- The plaza
- Jordan's house to the north of the plaza
- Your tower
- Some other buildings by your tower

Village is located at x:0 z:630 (or close to there)

Good luck! Text/call me when you're done. 248-345-0003
